## Synopsis

No Man's Canvas is a Jyv채skyl채 University project to recreate Reddit's /r/place concept in a smaller scale.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/vkoskiv/NoMansCanvas

cd NoMansCanvas

vapor build

vapor run serve

This deploys by default on localhost:8080, configurable in Config/server.json

# Dependencies

The React-based web client can be found [here](https://github.com/EliasHaaralahti/No-Mans-Canvas-Client)

This project requires the [Vapor 2](https://vapor.codes) framework, and [Swift 3.1](https://swift.org)

You also need a `mysql` db, and the `cmysql` library installed. Configure in Config/mysql.json

For debugging, you could also switch to an in-memory DB, but I don't think the current schema supports it.

*Caveat:* This backend was originally built in 2017, the Vapor 2 toolchain is no longer supported and may not work without some work. YMMV.
