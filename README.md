### DEPRECATED

This is the original backend server built in 2017. The new and (hopefully) last implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/vkoskiv/nmc2).

You will likely run into issues trying to use this project. It's running an out-of-date version of Swift and the Vapor framework, both of which are no longer supported. I've had issues getting this to build on newer versions of Swift.

The new implementation follows a more minimalistic approach. It's a small C program, only depending on a small set of high quality dependencies.

## Synopsis

No Man's Canvas is a Jyv채skyl채 University project to recreate Reddit's /r/place concept in a smaller scale.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/vkoskiv/NoMansCanvas

cd NoMansCanvas

vapor build

vapor run serve

This deploys by default on localhost:8080, configurable in Config/server.json

# Dependencies

The React-based web client can be found [here](https://github.com/EliasHaaralahti/No-Mans-Canvas-Client)

This project requires the [Vapor 2](https://vapor.codes) framework, and [Swift 3.1](https://swift.org)

You also need a `mysql` db, and the `cmysql` library installed. Configure in Config/mysql.json

For debugging, you could also switch to an in-memory DB, but I don't think the current schema supports it.

*Caveat:* This backend was originally built in 2017, the Vapor 2 toolchain is no longer supported and may not work without some work. YMMV.
